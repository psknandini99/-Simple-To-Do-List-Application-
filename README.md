                                        Sismple To- Do List application
                                        
Description:
        The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional to-do list application that provides users with a simple and effective 
        way to manage their tasks. The application is designed by using language “kotlin” in android studio platform.
How to setup the application:
        Step 1: Download the android studio 
        Step 2: Install Android Studio
        Step 3: Configure Android SDK
        Step 4: Setup virtual device(Emulator)
        Step 5: Create a New project
        Step 6: Build and run your App
How to Build and Run the simple To-Do List application:
         Step 1: Create a new android studio project
                 • Open android studio
                 • Select “Start a new android studio project”
        Step 2: Design the user interface (UI) 
                 • Open the res/layout/activity_main.xml file.
                 • Design the layout using XML, including components like EditText for task input, Button for adding tasks, and a RecyclerView to display tasks.
                 • Customize the layout according to your preferences.

        Step 3: Define the Data Model

                • Create a Java or Kotlin class to represent a Task.
                • Define properties such as task name, description, due date, priority, etc.
        Step 4: Implement TaskAdapter (for RecyclerView)
                • Create an adapter class (TaskAdapter) to bind the data to the RecyclerView.
                • Implement the ViewHolder pattern to efficiently manage views.
        Step 5: Implement TaskViewModel (Optional)
                • Create a ViewModel class to handle data operations, such as adding, editing, and deleting tasks.
                • Use the ViewModel to manage the UI-related data.

        Step 6: Connect UI with Data and ViewModel
                • In the MainActivity, instantiate the TaskViewModel.
                • Set up observers to update the UI when data changes
        Step 7: Implement To-Do Task Functionality
                • Capture user Input from the UI.
                • Use the Task View Model to add a new task to the list.

        Step 8: Implement Edit and Delete Functionality
                • Allow users to edit, update and delete tasks.
                • Update the UI and data accordingly.

        Step 9: Test Your Application
                • Run your application on an emulator or a physical device.
                • Test adding, editing, and deleting tasks to ensure everything works as expected.
